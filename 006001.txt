0.09113078101560754	7.280969749498868	O1	Hi, welcome! All right, so here we go. We have got two brand spanking new bedrooms, for the LEGO Friends characters. We have got[N]
7.5258835496601435	14.0702131089798	O1	one for Paisley and one for Autumn. And you know what they actually correspond with? Their houses.[N]
14.28474992419648	19.3861755666478	O1	And they match the color schemes and everything. So you can bet your sweet patootie that I'm going to be[N]
19.581726570728673	26.976609275042538	O1	fitting these into their houses somehow. They might need to be fitting their houses into this, I don't know. But today we're going to build paisleys. This[N]
27.005089034655278	31.80464257444703	O1	room has got Paisley and Leanna in their pyjamas, which is really fun.[N]
32.116005149220115	38.675524678466516	O1	And it's uh actually, I can't remember how much it is, but I found that it came out, I think it was twenty-two dollars here in Australia. The R R P is thirty dollars.[N]
38.848291596748126	43.56620899927388	O1	Once again, A U D would look at this. Oh my gosh. The graphic art on these stickers just.[N]
43.945919659808666	50.77313585828842	O1	There's so much story happening in here. There's so much happening on the actual cork board on her bulletin board. We'll have a look at that when we put them all on though.[N]
51.012351377363665	54.5569627554042	O1	We've got our instruction book, we get to see where Paisley lives in.[N]
54.61771290129363	61.80945222383581	O1	Where Leigh-Anne lives? Did we already know where Leigh-Anne lives? We must, cause we already heard her bedroom. Anyway, let's look at, oh my goodness, let's look at their pajamas.[N]
62.04677382012445	67.35134284434744	O1	So this is actually the second bedroom set that Paisley has come in cause she was also in Aaliyah's bedroom.[N]
67.52221305875172	74.34752699117266	O1	And she's got another pair of pyjamas. I've complained so much that the Lick of Rinse characters do not get pyjamas.[N]
74.64180532559605	81.84683269964253	O1	Well, now we're getting them, which is very exciting. I still want sleepy faces though. They're always so very, very wide awake. So her pajamas,[N]
81.90568614165461	89.76761827030958	O1	long ones with hearts on the front. Hearts are most definitely her emblem, and she has lots of pink in her color scheme as well. These are[N]
89.83596635607128	95.24305750893683	O1	so cute, these pyjamas, oh my gosh. So we've got her proper paisley face and hair.[N]
95.5525261609233	101.38679841198099	O1	And she has got a pet bunny rapper, Melody, who also comes in this set.[N]
101.66587530447838	107.98617097137733	O1	I think her family has actually also adopted a corgi, which doesn't unfortunately come in this set,[N]
108.02985634455219	113.32682186672147	O1	but does come in one of the other ones, which I will be doing. So we'll have to add that to her family house at some stage.[N]
113.70083407235204	119.81229207421121	O1	Okay, we've also got Leigh-Anne. She's wearing blue slippers with white socks. The socks need another coat of paint.[N]
120.05910831424947	127.56410413435133	O1	The white just is so translucent. Unless this is like deliberate, but I don't think it is cause it's a common trait with the white[N]
127.88496413396476	135.01025207462257	O1	printing on uh mini dolls, but her pajama top is just the cutest thing. So she's got matching coral sleeves,[N]
135.24187243491627	139.61425878196954	O1	long sleeves, long jammy pants, and she's got dumplings,[N]
139.98067304772786	146.4053931093282	O1	sleepy time dumplings printed on her shirt. And I'm gonna have a look at that a little bit closer in a moment, but let's put her head and her hair on.[N]
146.67878545237502	154.67878545237502	O1	And now I'm coming nice and close. Look at the front one. It's actually sleeping and drooling in its sleep. What did I say about the graphic art? So good.[N]
154.9489038295414	162.66844411285948	O1	Oh my goodness, the detailing. Now Paisley has got a paintbrush because Leanne has come over and they're doing some activities. They're doing some painting.[N]
163.05954333993049	169.98359155542076	O1	And Leanne obviously also needs a paintbrush, but she's gonna get the palette as well. She's gonna get the palette first. We actually have two different[N]
170.0424394352514	176.93041134180206	O1	colored paintbrushes now in Lego which is so good so we've got actually got more than those colors, actually think we have black one all right, we have[N]
177.18292325565375	183.750035162591	O1	colored tips, we've got blue and we've got green which is so nice, cause it used to just be green for so long. Okay.[N]
183.94557921394505	190.6930615412176	O1	Now for Paisley, we have, no, she has got a diary. And how do I know this is a diary?[N]
190.97594296583256	197.1842274225208	O1	Because I can tell from the handwriting on it, it's got a little school book margin down the side, and there's a broken heart[N]
197.43103253819612	204.54684252164876	O1	were drawn on it I wonder who broke her heart what's been going on in the drama of paisley's life, I don't know.[N]
204.77086494207015	212.60052529390302	O1	Or maybe it's just like two sides of the heart, like best friend hearts and it's yet to be split. I don't know. You can make it whatever story you want. I think there's been some[N]
213.025787439492	218.05887194890843	O1	broken heart romance happening, unrequited love in Paisley's life. So she's got her diary,[N]
218.3607426610226	226.01953279845128	O1	and she's gonna have to hide that somewhere. Luckily, we're building her a bedroom. We'll find a nice hidey hole for it. Now, they're over here painting, so we've got some paint pot,[N]
226.20179436048247	232.98723301402762	O1	paint pots, we've got some paint pots on the floor. They're gonna need lids, but we'll fix that in a moment. Got some clips going out the back.[N]
233.2815169106325	240.61563139196716	O1	And actually I said this was the floor, this is actually not the floor, this is the tabletop. So we've got a tablet or an iPad with.[N]
241.25732914246814	248.3731391259207	O1	So they're playing a YouTube tutorial of painting on a little clay gloop or a little white plasticky gloop thing.[N]
248.56300975218716	253.4270929401694	O1	Uh I'm calling it a gloop cause it's a cute little gloop with ears. And we actually have these.[N]
253.6530287510125	260.7517517130247	O1	Oh, we got these in Gabby's dollhouse theme, but with prints on them. So now we've got just plain ones ready to be painted.[N]
260.96057825370156	267.67008200597564	O1	I wish one of them had a little bit of painting on it already. That would have been so cool. Maybe I should decorate one. That would be kind of fun.[N]
270.1553091790727	275.784017730971	O1	That might have to happen, but what am I gonna make it? I can make it like the cutest little kawaii kitty.[N]
276.00857071762954	283.1580241777258	O1	Anyway, let's get stuff on here. All right. I'm gonna make it the cutest little kitty gloops. Oh.[N]
283.2838373191336	290.3616464788619	O1	Okay, I have to give it a try. It's so small. Okay, let's build. So we are building Paisley's bedroom[N]
290.41101640148736	296.92497610240736	O1	in her house, so in Paisley's proper big house, which we always call Paisley's house, but it's not like she pays the mortgage.[N]
297.3711298015544	303.91735015493356	O1	So it's not really her house, but anyway. So she shares a bedroom. I was having trouble, a bed-[N]
304.0388726954383	311.741314832953	O1	room with her little sister Ella, but what if like now they've expanded? What if I expanded the house and give them each their own[N]
311.8362501460862	319.6222362491072	O1	full-sized room, I wonder if that I'm afraid to do that without messing up the architecture cause it's such a cool mid-century[N]
319.6639971074973	327.2183517258617	O1	modern style house. Anyway, concentrating on her bigger scale bedroom here. She's got her bed with a nice rounded bedspread on it.[N]
327.27722185441814	334.65881511668243	O1	And it opens underneath, there's a hiding spot underneath, so she can put her diary in here and no one will be any the wiser.[N]
334.9834685240505	342.1486261814026	O1	Except, do you reckon Leanne might go snooping while Paisley's in the bathroom? That would be such a betrayal of trust, but oh my goodness,[N]
342.1998872457239	350.1282651940818	O1	the drama. Okay. All right. Let's concentrate on the rest of this building. We've got a gorgeous little rug in sweet little pastels[N]
350.43583158000945	356.456158800853	O1	down here just uh on the bed, side so when you step out you've got something nice and warm to put your tootsies on.[N]
356.77320314398594	364.58577647437835	O1	And there's a hook on the outside of the bed, which like on the outside of the bedroom, which is really cool. So that's for her headphones. I just love the fact that[N]
364.883842654375	372.3072190237553	O1	everything doesn't have to be an enclosed box, when it's this style of room. You can put stuff on the outside too. Okay, we have got a,[N]
372.51604556443215	379.96979144457566	O1	kind of looks like a coffee machine, or the beginnings of a coffee machine, but I don't know that it is. We're up to bag number two, and this is where we get another, oh my goodness, the cutest thing in the world.[N]
380.29444485194375	386.88055717074315	O1	These brand new big squishy stuffies. Oh my gosh, what could they possibly be like?[N]
387.19951490429776	392.1338373197376	O1	So collectible big squishies and this one is a big blue penguin,[N]
392.31609888176877	399.1604299125962	O1	which is obviously Paisley's a favorite friend, and it will fit on her lap too. It sits so cutely on her lap.[N]
399.2819079556493	403.9295777874452	O1	Cutely is not a word, but I like it and it works, so shush. Okay, let's see if I can pop her[N]
403.97136089456126	411.8333041475791	O1	over, no I can't sit her on the bed yet, I can put the squishy over here, oh and there's some more of these giant squishies in the minifigures series,[N]
412.09339175257725	419.6686379244997	O1	which I am going to collect and get the AnkaVert, the multi-mini doll soon, so make sure you subscribe cause that is,[N]
419.6933340101753	426.8218959167136	O1	yeah, that's not too far away. We finally got them here in Australia. Look at all the stuff on this board. So we've got pictures we've seen before. One's for us, Layla.[N]
427.12997062015256	434.54522960778627	O1	Ones with the beekeepers house that they like her grandparents and here, what's happening with this elf story like they're all reading the elf[N]
435.0526528946969	439.8275409408111	O1	s- kind of storyline and I wanna know what the actual[N]
440.21293336970575	445.32900902966543	O1	fiction fantasy is and I actually want it all as a dedicated mini doll line.[N]
445.7130408831013	452.81367723553524	O1	Oh, my brain just turned to fizz even thinking about that. I couldn't get words out. Oh, I just keep imagining that we're gonna get like this spin-off line with the[N]
452.914285973756	460.3181536137628	O1	fantasy theme that we keep getting hinted in the friends theme but, you know, it's probably just a pipe dream.[N]
460.34522690991975	466.8439907310953	O1	But imagine, just imagine if they have this whole storyline just coming up soon. It's been hinted all along.[N]
468.26034461768063	474.3584978814912	O1	Be perfect all right, so we're getting this bedroom together, got some rods up along the back wall.[N]
474.4989763364063	481.8919609462975	O1	They're actually not rods. They're supposed to be strings to hang the fairy lights from. I love fairy lights so much. Let's get these all on here. And[N]
482.1843537012065	490.07286193286996	O1	we've got a lava lamp, buildable lava lamp. This is familiar. Is this the same lava lamp from the furniture store? It's kind of,[N]
490.2247317354121	497.12980178776604	O1	it's like a more luxe version, maybe. It's not exactly the same build, but it's the same s-. It looks enough like the same.[N]
497.44875952132077	503.8506968876672	O1	Maybe it's like a dupe, or maybe it's an upgraded version. Anyway, we've seen that before in the furniture store.[N]
504.03865412351183	509.0736297746242	O1	We haven't seen this stool though with the raffia kind of pillow on the top. I'm trynna figure out where that goes.[N]
509.33754416046577	516.7665717062077	O1	So it's over here next to this little corner desk. And then we have got a[N]
517.0836605467924	524.7310370878682	O1	kind of a side table which is also a turntable, cause we've got the best record sticker on here,[N]
525.4183002288771	531.1633662137037	O1	ah good vinyl there and we've got the uh the needle, I just had a thought.[N]
531.4253672091237	538.750003733253	O1	It's entirely got nothing to do with anything that we're building right now. So we've also got the drink bottle for Melody, but my thought was[N]
539.0537433383373	545.159505666383	O1	what if what if we had like a sub theme for the Lego friends line where we actually get those[N]
545.4784633999376	551.7664872900147	O1	fantasy elves characters come into their world. That would be amazing. Okay. All right.[N]
552.11961906645	560.0632151432782	O1	I'm gonna just keep wishing it into being gonna manifest and manifesting heart. O K.[N]
560.0746064909052	564.1730699286745	O1	But back on the build, so we've got her record cover, a poster of her mum.[N]
564.3387527867766	572.2671307351345	O1	So this is just a bigger version of what we see in her little room in the full house and then on the corner table there's a vase with a[N]
572.3126961256423	575.4757084825429	O1	flour and a couple of cups with a.[N]
575.5649258731368	582.1168641490552	O1	They can be water for washing the brushes in or they can be little drinking cups and a tree.[N]
582.3712560802401	590.2692422691088	O1	A tree growing up outside, just up the side wall. That's cute. And this, I kind of feel like it's an old timey[N]
590.569244088253	598.2299253673774	O1	camera but it's a little bit not complex enough to look like that, so I don't know, that that's what it is, so let's see if it becomes clear as we[N]
598.4672302771218	605.2298639866872	O1	go along. We've got a keyboard with two legs, so that's gonna just kind of stand up on its own.[N]
605.5127787843909	613.3367212136844	O1	A couple of microphones clipped in on the back. That's nice and neat and tidy. And then some manuscript up here. So this might be a song that she's composing.[N]
613.3785043208004	620.788575952132	O1	Let's have a look, this is actually, the we've actually got a treble clef and a bass clef two hands happening, but you wouldn't want those first couple of notes to be played together[N]
620.8493149736586	627.6708633092322	O1	same time cause they would be entirely discordant, anyway, it's so nice to have, something a bit different and we've got a white[N]
627.8948634809278	634.8208028381139	O1	guitar which goes on here, which is not a coffee machine, it's a stand where the guitar just kind of leans in it,[N]
635.037238443026	640.7936957754796	O1	fixed on it's not fixed on, but it's it is secure enough as long as you don't shake it too much.[N]
640.8772174922601	648.7771170715505	O1	Really cool. Okay, and I forgot to put Melody in. There's actually a spot over here next to the, water bottle. Obviously I was being distracted by my fanfic[N]
648.835987200107	654.6531390566355	O1	with the with the elves fantasy series and forgot about that. So let's get this guitar[N]
655.0024885496792	661.4955566970413	O1	into Paisley's hand, so she's got everything she needs here cause she loves music, to keep practicing all the stuff for her music career.[N]
661.892340473563	668.0208854968625	O1	I wonder what happens this year with her Layla alter ego. I think it might be, I think it might be done, but it was fun.[N]
668.3075825779579	674.400040167955	O1	And because Leanne was her biggest fan, she's here singing with her as well. There's so much in this room.[N]
674.7417805967635	680.1697577410056	O1	And it's so cute! Look at that little penguin stuffy! Oh my gosh, and the painting.[N]
680.5646726245571	687.3273508315742	O1	Yeah, lots and lots of cool stuff in here. Next job we'll be fitting it into her house and[N]
687.7469173033498	694.7715965057869	O1	or will I be doing autumn street? I don't know, but I'm definitely going to do it at some stage soon. So let me know your thoughts on this room set.[N]
694.8171618962945	700.6300231519199	O1	I think that it got added to your collection. There's just so much stuff in it. And thumbs up,[N]
700.6855748171442	704.2074146242938	O1	Take that one, and give it a subscribe, and a little,[N]
704.2890674481041	710.3278867632986	O1	yeah all the things, do all the things you know what to do not Youtube newbies, all right I'll see you again.[N]
710.9397010718219	712.5971421515432	O1	Another video soon. Bye.[N]
